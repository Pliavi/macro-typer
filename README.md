# Typewriter Macro Presenter

From a file in your workspace, the editor itself "types" some predetermined codes, you can use for an code presentation without the need of type while speaking or see the text appearing directly on the screen in an artificial way.

## Known Issues

- Break line does not behave as is, it's comes after ALL the text was typed instead of in the place it's determined.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1
- It just works

### 0.0.2
- Break lines works perfectly now;
- It calls "format document" command after typing
